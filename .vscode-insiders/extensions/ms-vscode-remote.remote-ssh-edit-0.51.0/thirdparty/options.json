If the command returns a zero exit status then the condition is considered true. Commands containing whitespace characters must be quoted. The following character sequences in the command will be expanded prior to execution: `%L' will be substituted by the first component of the local host name, `%l' will be substituted by the local host name (including any domain name), `%h' will be substituted by the target host name, `%n' will be substituted by the original target host name specified on the command-line, `%p' the destination port, `%r' by the remote login username, and `%u' by the username of the user running ssh(1).\nThe other keywords' criteria must be single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section.
