#gs_access_key_id = <your google access key ID>
#gs_secret_access_key = <your google secret access key>
# The ability to specify an alternate storage host and port

[Boto]

# http_socket_timeout specifies the timeout (in seconds) used to tell httplib
# how long to wait for socket timeouts. The default is 70 seconds. Note that
# this timeout only applies to httplib, not to httplib2 (which is used for
# OAuth2 refresh/access token exchanges).
#http_socket_timeout = 70

# The following two options control the use of a secure transport for requests
# to S3 and Google Cloud Storage. It is highly recommended to set both options
# to True in production environments, especially when using OAuth2 bearer token
# authentication with Google Cloud Storage.

# Set 'https_validate_certificates' to False to disable server certificate
# checking. The default for this option in the boto library is currently
# 'False' (to avoid breaking apps that depend on invalid certificates); it is
# therefore strongly recommended to always set this option explicitly to True
# in configuration files, to protect against "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
https_validate_certificates = True

# 'debug' controls the level of debug messages printed for the XML API only:
# 0 for none, 1 for basic boto debug, 2 for all boto debug plus HTTP
# requests/responses.
#debug = <0, 1, or 2>

# 'num_retries' controls the number of retry attempts made when errors occur
# during data transfers. The default is 6.
# Note 1: You can cause gsutil to retry failures effectively infinitely by
# setting this value to a large number (like 10000). Doing that could be useful
# in cases where your network connection occasionally fails and is down for an
# extended period of time, because when it comes back up gsutil will continue
# retrying.  However, in general we recommend not setting the value above 10,
# because otherwise gsutil could appear to "hang" due to excessive retries
# (since unless you run gsutil -D you won't see any logged evidence that gsutil
# is retrying).
# Note 2: Don't set this value to 0, as it will cause boto to fail when reusing
# HTTP connections.
#num_retries = <integer value>

# 'max_retry_delay' controls the max delay (in seconds) between retries. The
# default value is 60, so the backoff sequence will be 1 seconds, 2 seconds, 4,
# 8, 16, 32, and then 60 for all subsequent retries for a given HTTP request.
# Note: At present this value only impacts the XML API and the JSON API uses a
# fixed value of 60.
#max_retry_delay = <integer value>

# To use a proxy, edit and uncomment the proxy and proxy_port lines.
# If you need a user/password with this proxy, edit and uncomment
# those lines as well. If your organization also disallows DNS
# lookups by client machines, set proxy_rdns to True (the default).
# If you have installed gsutil through the Cloud SDK and have 
# configured proxy settings in gcloud, those proxy settings will 
# override any other options (including those set here, along with 
# any settings in proxy-related environment variables). Otherwise, 
# if proxy_host and proxy_port are not specified in this file and
# one of the OS environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy, or
# HTTPS_PROXY is defined, gsutil will use the proxy server specified
# in these environment variables, in order of precedence according
# to how they are listed above.
#proxy = <proxy host>

[GoogleCompute]

# 'service_account' specifies the a Google Compute Engine service account to
# use for credentials. This value is intended for use only on Google Compute
# Engine virtual machines and usually lives in /etc/boto.cfg. Most users
# shouldn't need to edit this part of the config.
#service_account = default

[GSUtil]

# 'resumable_threshold' specifies the smallest file size [bytes] for which
# resumable Google Cloud Storage uploads are attempted. The default is 8388608
# (8 MiB).
#resumable_threshold = 8388608

# 'rsync_buffer_lines' specifies the number of lines of bucket or directory
# listings saved in each temp file during sorting. (The complete set is
# split across temp files and separately sorted/merged, to avoid needing to
# fit everything in memory at once.) If you are trying to synchronize very
# large directories/buckets (e.g., containing millions or more objects),
# having too small a value here can cause gsutil to run out of open file
# handles. If that happens, you can try to increase the number of open file
# handles your system allows (e.g., see 'man ulimit' on Linux; see also
# http://docs.python.org/2/library/resource.html). If you can't do that (or
# if you're already at the upper limit), increasing rsync_buffer_lines will
# cause gsutil to use fewer file handles, but at the cost of more memory. With
# rsync_buffer_lines set to 32000 and assuming a typical URL is 100 bytes
# long, gsutil will require approximately 10 MiB of memory while building
# the synchronization state, and will require approximately 60 open file
# descriptors to build the synchronization state over all 1M source and 1M
# destination URLs. Memory and file descriptors are only consumed while
# building the state; once the state is built, it resides in two temp files that
# are read and processed incrementally during the actual copy/delete
# operations.
#rsync_buffer_lines = 32000

# 'state_dir' specifies the base location where files that
# need a static location are stored, such as pointers to credentials,
# resumable transfer tracker files, and the last software update check.
# By default these files are stored in ~/.gsutil
#state_dir = <file_path>
# gsutil periodically checks whether a new version of the gsutil software is
# available. 'software_update_check_period' specifies the number of days
# between such checks. The default is 30. Setting the value to 0 disables
# periodic software update checks.
#software_update_check_period = 30

# 'tab_completion_timeout' controls the timeout (in seconds) for tab
# completions that involve remote requests (such as bucket or object names).
# If tab completion does not succeed within this timeout, no tab completion
# suggestions will be returned.
# A value of 0 will disable completions that involve remote requests.
#tab_completion_timeout = 5

# 'parallel_process_count' and 'parallel_thread_count' specify the number
# of OS processes and Python threads, respectively, to use when executing
# operations in parallel. The default settings should work well as configured,
# however, to enhance performance for transfers involving large numbers of
# files, you may experiment with hand tuning these values to optimize
# performance for your particular system configuration.
#parallel_process_count = 4
#parallel_thread_count = 5

# 'parallel_composite_upload_threshold' specifies the maximum size of a file to
# upload in a single stream. Files larger than this threshold will be
# partitioned into component parts and uploaded in parallel and then composed
# into a single object.
# The number of components will be the smaller of
# ceil(file_size / parallel_composite_upload_component_size) and
# MAX_COMPONENT_COUNT. The current value of MAX_COMPONENT_COUNT is
# 1024.
# If 'parallel_composite_upload_threshold' is set to 0, then automatic parallel
# uploads will never occur.
# Setting an extremely low threshold is unadvisable. The vast majority of
# environments will see degraded performance for thresholds below 80M, and it
# is almost never advantageous to have a threshold below 20M.
# 'parallel_composite_upload_component_size' specifies the ideal size of a
# component in bytes, which will act as an upper bound to the size of the
# components if ceil(file_size / parallel_composite_upload_component_size) is
# less than MAX_COMPONENT_COUNT.
# Values can be provided either in bytes or as human-readable values
# (e.g., "150M" to represent 150 mebibytes)
#
# Note: At present parallel composite uploads are disabled by default, because
# using composite objects requires a compiled crcmod (see "gsutil help crcmod"),
# and for operating systems that don't already have this package installed this
# makes gsutil harder to use. Google is actively working with a number of the
# Linux distributions to get crcmod included with the stock distribution. Once
# that is done we will re-enable parallel composite uploads by default in
# gsutil.
#
# Note: Parallel composite uploads should not be used with NEARLINE, COLDLINE,
# or ARCHIVE storage class buckets, as doing this incurs an early deletion
# charge for each component object.
#
# Note: Parallel composite uploads are not enabled with Cloud KMS encrypted
# objects as a source or destination, as composition with KMS objects is not yet
# supported.

#parallel_composite_upload_threshold = 0
#parallel_composite_upload_component_size = 50M

# 'sliced_object_download_threshold' and
# 'sliced_object_download_component_size' have analogous functionality to
# their respective parallel_composite_upload config values.
# 'sliced_object_download_max_components' specifies the maximum number of
# slices to be used when performing a sliced object download. It is not
# restricted by MAX_COMPONENT_COUNT.
#sliced_object_download_threshold = 0
#sliced_object_download_component_size = 50M
#sliced_object_download_max_components = 4

# Compressed transport encoded uploads buffer chunks of compressed data. When
# running a composite upload and/or many uploads in parallel, compression may
# consume more memory than available. This setting restricts the number of
# compressed transport encoded uploads running in parallel such that they
# don't consume more memory than set here. This is 2GiB by default.
# Values can be provided either in bytes or as human-readable values
# (e.g., "2G" to represent 2 gibibytes)
#max_upload_compression_buffer_size = 2G

# GZIP compression level, if using compression. Reducing this can have
# a dramatic impact on compression speed with minor size increases.
# This is a value from 0-9, with 9 being max compression.
# A good level to try is 6, which is the default used by the gzip tool.
#gzip_compression_level = 9

# 'task_estimation_threshold' controls how many files or objects gsutil
# processes before it attempts to estimate the total work that will be
# performed by the command. Estimation makes extra directory listing or API
# list calls and is performed only if multiple processes and/or threads are
# used. Estimation can slightly increase cost due to extra
# listing calls; to disable it entirely, set this value to 0.
#task_estimation_threshold=30000

# 'use_magicfile' specifies if the 'file --mime <filename>' command should be
# used to guess content types instead of the default filename extension-based
# mechanism. Available on UNIX and macOS (and possibly on Windows, if you're
# running Cygwin or some other package that provides implementations of
# UNIX-like commands). When available and enabled use_magicfile should be more
# robust because it analyzes file contents in addition to extensions.
#use_magicfile = False

# 'content_language' specifies the ISO 639-1 language code of the content, to be
# passed in the Content-Language header. By default no Content-Language is sent.
# See the ISO 639-1 column of
# http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php for a list of
# language codes.

# 'check_hashes' specifies how strictly to require integrity checking for
# downloaded data. Legal values are:
#   'if_fast_else_fail' - (default) Only integrity check if the digest
#       will run efficiently (using compiled code), else fail the download.
#   'if_fast_else_skip' - Only integrity check if the server supplies a
#       hash and the local digest computation will run quickly, else skip the
#       check.
#   'always' - Always check download integrity regardless of possible
#       performance costs.
#   'never' - Don't perform download integrity checks. This setting is
#       not recommended except for special cases such as measuring download
#       performance excluding time for integrity checking.
# This option exists to assist users who wish to download a GCS composite object
# and are unable to install crcmod with the C-extension. CRC32c is the only
# available integrity check for composite objects, and without the C-extension,
# download performance can be significantly degraded by the digest computation.
# This option is ignored for daisy-chain copies, which don't compute hashes but
# instead (inexpensively) compare the cloud source and destination hashes.
#check_hashes = if_fast_else_fail

# 'encryption_key' specifies a single customer-supplied encryption key that
# will be used for all data written to Google Cloud Storage. See
# "gsutil help encryption" for more information
# Encryption key: RFC 4648 section 4 base64-encoded AES256 string
# Warning: If decrypt_key is specified without an encrypt_key, objects will be
# decrypted when copied in the cloud.

# The ability to specify an alternative JSON API version is primarily for cloud
# storage service developers.
#json_api_version = v1

# Specifies the API to use when interacting with cloud storage providers. If the
# gsutil command supports this API for the provider, it will be used instead of
# the default API. Commands typically default to XML for S3 and JSON for GCS.
# Note that if any encryption configuration options are set (see above), the
# JSON API will be used for interacting with Google Cloud Storage buckets even
# if XML is preferred, as gsutil does not currently support this functionality
# when using the XML API.

[OAuth2]
# This section specifies options used with OAuth2 authentication.

# 'token_cache' specifies how the OAuth2 client should cache access tokens.
# Valid values are:
#  'in_memory': an in-memory cache is used. This is only useful if the boto
#      client instance (and with it the OAuth2 plugin instance) persists
#      across multiple requests.
#  'file_system' : access tokens will be cached in the file system, in files
#      whose names include a key derived from the refresh token the access token
#      based on.
# The default is 'file_system'.
#token_cache = file_system
#token_cache = in_memory

# 'token_cache_path_pattern' specifies a path pattern for token cache files.
# This option is only relevant if token_cache = file_system.
# The value of this option should be a path, with place-holders '%(key)s' (which
# will be replaced with a key derived from the refresh token the cached access
# token was based on), and (optionally), %(uid)s (which will be replaced with
# the UID of the current user, if available via os.getuid()).
# Note that the config parser itself interpolates '%' placeholders, and hence
# the above placeholders need to be escaped as '%%(key)s'.
# The default value of this option is
#  token_cache_path_pattern = <tmpdir>/oauth2client-tokencache.%%(uid)s.%%(key)s
# where <tmpdir> is the system-dependent default temp directory.

# The following options specify the label and endpoint URIs for the OAUth2

# 'oauth2_refresh_retries' controls the number of retry attempts made when
# rate limiting errors occur for OAuth2 requests to retrieve an access token.
# The default value is 6.
#oauth2_refresh_retries = <integer value>

# The following options specify the OAuth2 client identity and secret that is
# used when requesting and using OAuth2 tokens. If not specified, a default
# OAuth2 client for the gsutil tool is used; for uses of the boto library (with
# OAuth2 authentication plugin) in other client software, it is recommended to
# use a tool/client-specific OAuth2 client. For more information on OAuth2, see
