# Application Insights for Node.js

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/applicationinsights.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/applicationinsights)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js)

[Azure Application Insights][] gathers correlated metrics, logs, and exceptions
for each transaction (request) in a distributed system and reports these in the
Azure Portal. Add this Node.js SDK to Node.js services in your system to include
deep info about Node.js processes and their external dependencies such as
database and cache services to those reports.

[Azure Application Insights]: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/

By default this library tracks incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, several
system metrics, and exceptions. You can track more aspects of your app and
system using the API described below.

## Getting Started

1. Create an Application Insights resource in Azure by following [these instructions][].
2. Grab the _Instrumentation Key_ (aka "ikey") from the resource you created in
   step 1. Later, you'll either add it to your app's environment variables or
   use it directly in your scripts.
3. Add the Application Insights Node.js SDK to your app's dependencies and
   package.json:
     ```bash
     npm install --save applicationinsights
     ```
4. As early as possible in your app's code, load the Application Insights
   package:
     ```javascript
     let appInsights = require('applicationinsights');
     ```
5. Configure the local SDK by calling `appInsights.setup('_your_ikey_');`, using
   the ikey you grabbed in step 2. Or put this ikey in the
   `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` environment variable and call
   `appInsights.setup()` without parameters.
   > For more configuration options see below.
6. Finally, start automatically collecting and sending data by calling
   `appInsights.start();`.

[these instructions]: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-create-new-resource/


## Basic Usage

To track HTTP requests, unhandled exceptions and system metrics:

```javascript
let appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
appInsights.setup("_your_ikey_").start();
```

* If the instrumentation key is set in the environment variable
  APPINSIGHTS\_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY, `.setup()` can be called with no
  arguments. This makes it easy to use different ikeys for different
  environments.

Load the Application Insights library (i.e. `require("applicationinsights")`) as
early as possible in your scripts, before loading other packages. This is needed
so that the Application Insights libary can prepare later packages for tracking.
If you encounter conflicts with other libraries doing similar preparation, try
loading the Application Insights library after those.

Because of the way JavaScript handles callbacks, additional work is necessary to
track a request across external dependencies and later callbacks. By default
this additional tracking is enabled; disable it by calling
`appInsights.setAutoDependencyCorrelation(false)` as described in the
Configuration section below.


## Configuration

The appInsights object provides a number of configuration methods. They are
listed in the following snippet with their default values.

```javascript
let appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
appInsights.setup("<instrumentation_key>")
    .setAutoDependencyCorrelation(true)
    .setAutoCollectRequests(true)
    .setAutoCollectPerformance(true)
    .setAutoCollectExceptions(true)
    .setAutoCollectDependencies(true)
    .setAutoCollectConsole(true)
    .start();
```

### Sampling

By default, the SDK will send all collected data to the Application Insights service. If you collect a lot of data, you might want to enable sampling to reduce the amount of data sent. Set the `samplingPercentage` field on the Config object of a Client to accomplish this. Setting `samplingPercentage` to 100 (the default) means all data will be sent, and 0 means nothing will be sent.

If you are using automatic correlation, all data associated with a single request will be included or excluded as a unit.

Add code such as the following to enable sampling:

```javascript
const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
appInsights.setup("<instrumentation_key>");
appInsights.client.config.samplingPercentage = 33; // 33% of all telemetry will be sent to Application Insights
appInsights.start();
```

### Automatic third-party instrumentation

In order to track context across asynchronous calls, some changes are required in third party libraries such as mongodb and redis.
By default ApplicationInsights will use `diagnostic-channel-publishers` to monkey-patch some of these libraries.
This can be disabled by setting the `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NO_DIAGNOSTIC_CHANNEL` environment variable. Note that by setting that
environment variable, events may no longer be correctly associated with the right operation. Individual monkey-patches can be
disabled by setting the `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NO_PATCH_MODULES` environment variable to a comma separated list of packages to
disable, e.g. `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NO_PATCH_MODULES=console,redis` to avoid patching the `console` and `redis` packages.

Currently there are 6 packages which are instrumented: `bunyan`, `console`, `mongodb`, `mongodb-core`, `mysql` and `redis`.

The `bunyan` package and `console` messages will generate Application Insights Trace events based on whether `setAutoCollectConsole` is enabled. The `mongodb`, `mysql` and `redis` packages will generate Application Insights Dependency events based on whether `setAutoCollectDependencies` is enabled.

## Track custom metrics

You can track any request, event, metric or exception using the Application
Insights client. Examples follow:

```javascript
let appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
appInsights.setup().start(); // assuming ikey in env var. start() can be omitted to disable any non-custom data
let client = appInsights.client;
client.trackEvent("my custom event", {customProperty: "custom property value"});
client.trackException(new Error("handled exceptions can be logged with this method"));
client.trackMetric("custom metric", 3);
client.trackTrace("trace message");

let http = require("http");
http.createServer( (req, res) => {
  client.trackRequest(req, res); // Place at the beginning of your request handler
});
```

## Preprocess data with Telemetry Processors

```javascript
public addTelemetryProcessor(telemetryProcessor: (envelope: Contracts.Envelope, context: { http.RequestOptions, http.ClientRequest, http.ClientResponse, correlationContext }) => boolean)
```

You can process and filter collected data before it is sent for retention using
_Telemetry Processors_. Telemetry processors are called one by one in the
order they were added before the telemetry item is sent to the cloud.

If a telemetry processor returns false or throws an error that telemetry item
will not be sent.

All telemetry processors receive the telemetry data and its envelope to inspect and
modify. They also receive a context object with available request information
and the persistent request context as provided by
`appInsights.getCorrelationContext()` (if automatic dependency correlation is
enabled).

The TypeScript type for a telemetry processor is:

```typescript
telemetryProcessor: (envelope: ContractsModule.Contracts.Envelope, context: { http.RequestOptions, http.ClientRequest, http.ClientResponse, correlationContext }) => boolean;
```

For example, a processor that removes stack trace data from exceptions might be
written and added as follows:

```javascript
function removeStackTraces ( envelope, context ) {
  if (envelope.data.baseType === "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.ExceptionData") {
    var data = envelope.data.baseData;
    if (data.exceptions && data.exceptions.length > 0) {
      for (var i = 0; i < data.exceptions.length; i++) {
        var exception = data.exceptions[i];
        exception.parsedStack = null;
        exception.hasFullStack = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}

appInsights.client.addTelemetryProcessor(removeStackTraces);
```

More info on the telemetry API is available in [the docs][].

## Use multiple instrumentation keys

You can create multiple Azure Application Insights resources and send different
data to each by using their respective instrumentation keys ("ikey"). For
example:

```javascript
let appInsights = require("applicationinsights");

// configure auto-collection under one ikey
appInsights.setup("_ikey-A_").start();

// track some events manually under another ikey
let otherClient = appInsights.getClient("_ikey-B_");
otherClient.trackEvent("my custom event");
```

## Examples

* Track dependencies

    ```javascript
    let appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
    let client = appInsights.getClient();

    var success = false;
    let startTime = Date.now();
    // execute dependency call here....
    let duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    success = true;

    client.trackDependency("dependency name", "command name", duration, success);
    ```

* Assign custom properties to be included with all events

    ```javascript
    appInsights.client.commonProperties = {
      environment: process.env.SOME_ENV_VARIABLE
    };
    ```

* Manually track all HTTP GET requests

    Note that all requests are tracked by default. To disable automatic
    collection, call `.setAutoCollectRequests(false)` before calling `start()`.

    ```javascript
    var server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      if ( req.method === "GET" ) {
          appInsights.client.trackRequest(req, res);
      }
      // other work here....
      res.end();
    });
    ```

* Track server startup time

    ```javascript
    let start = Date.now();
    server.on("listening", () => {
      let duration = Date.now() - start;
      appInsights.client.trackMetric("server startup time", duration);
    });
    ```
